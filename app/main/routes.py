Poor sleep can contribute to increased stress, anxiety, and depression, while good sleep supports emotional regulation and cognitive function. Over a seven-day period, tracking sleep quality provides insights into an individual’s ability to recover and manage daily challenges. Since sleep disturbances often correlate with mental health challenges, incorporating this variable into a mental health prediction model improves the model's ability to identify patterns and make accurate predictions, ultimately supporting more personalized and actionable feedback.",

Frequent consumption of healthy foods is linked to lower risks of depression and anxiety, while poor dietary habits can exacerbate mental health challenges. By asking about the frequency of healthy diet use over the past month, the model can identify patterns between diet consistency and mental health outcomes. This information enhances the ability to provide accurate predictions and tailored feedback to support individuals in improving their overall well-being.",

Regular social activities help buffer stress, improve mood, and promote resilience against mental health challenges.

Positive social environments promote well-being by encouraging interactions and creating a buffer against mental health challenges.
